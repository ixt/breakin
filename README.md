#BreakIn

A breakout variation wrote in ncurses

Be aware, this will delete files if left in the state it is.
It is currently primed to delete files in your current directory.
It can be set to play with files in other directories;
just change the "directoryOfChoice" variable to the path of your choice.
(you can also disable this by commenting out the line pointed out in file.cpp)

Aim of the game is to avoid hitting the blocks with your ball,
stop playing by pressing q. controls are h or left, l or right and space to start.

There is no way to win.

Good Luck
