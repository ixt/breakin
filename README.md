#BreakIn

A breakout variation wrote in ncurses

Be aware, this will delete files if left in the state it is.
It is currently primed to delete files in your current directory.
It can be set to play with files in other directories;
just change the "directoryOfChoice" variable to the path of your choice.

Aim of the game is to avoid hitting the blocks with your ball,
remain in game for the length of the timer to progress to the next level.

Good Luck


TO-DO:
Implement Timer
Implement the "level" screens
